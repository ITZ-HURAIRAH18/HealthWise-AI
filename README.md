## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get HealthWise AI up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/HealthWise-AI.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/HealthWise-AI.git)
    cd HealthWise-AI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Get your Google Gemini API Key:**
    * Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a new API key.
    * **Important:** For production environments, it is highly recommended to use environment variables or a backend proxy to handle your API key securely. **Never expose your API key directly in client-side code in a production application.**

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    * Open the `src/Chatbot.js` file.
    * Locate the `API_KEY` constant and replace `"AIzaSyBWkDcaP0O0D6NfTzFhYe9FVEsMGEtRvPc"` with your actual Gemini API key:
        ```javascript
        const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"; // <--- Replace this
        ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
